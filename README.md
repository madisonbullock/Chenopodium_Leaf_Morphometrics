# Chenopodium_Leaf_Morphometrics #
This respository is comprised of the R code and data used in the analysis of landmarks, elliptical Fourier descriptors, and shape features in the leaves of _Chenopodium oahuense_ subspecies. The code can potentially be used for other species, including those like _C. oahuense_ that display levels of polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, and heteroblasty in their leaves. Seeds were collected from natural populations and then grown in a greenhouse at San Francisco State University. Data was collected 10 times over the course of 18 weeks. The code and protocol was largely taken and adapted from:
